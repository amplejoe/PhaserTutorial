Autocompletion for Phaser in Atom Editor can be accomplished via tern, which is a stand-alone, editor-independent JavaScript analyzer. 
A special tern plugin for the Phaser Framework (tern-phaser) is as well needed. Integration for Windows is described by HTML5 Game Dev Forums
user Nathan Lovato on http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/17610-guide-phaser-auto-completion-in-atom-with-tern-phaser/, yet following
workaround should work for all platforms:

1. apm install atom-ternjs

2. Navigate to ~/.atom/packages/atom-ternjs
		npm install tern
		npm install tern-phaser

3. Navigate to ~/.atom/packages/atom-ternjs/node_modules
		copy /tern-phaser/phaser.js /tern/plugin

4. Create a minimal .tern-project file in project root (always try to restart server via Packages > Atom Ternjs configure+save and restart/restart server)
	
		File .tern-project contents (see PhaserTutorial/.tern-project):
	    {   "ecmaVersion": 5,   "libs": ["browser"],   "plugins": {     "phaser": {}   } }
